# Josh Dibble's Website

A Flutter web project.

## What is this?

I created this website for two reasons:

1. I wanted to try Flutter web properly and create a completely responsive website using only Flutter.

2. I want people to be able to see and use the code behind my website to see how great Flutter is!

## If you want to run my website locally

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
